# üöÄ TaskMaster Forex Bots - Project State Summary (Save Point)
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Status:** Ready to Resume - PC2 CPU Utilization Fixed

## üéØ Current Project State

### ‚úÖ **ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED:**
1. **Ray Cluster Setup:** Successfully configured 2-PC distributed Ray cluster
   - **Head PC1:** `192.168.1.10:6379` (RTX 3090)
   - **Worker PC2:** `192.168.1.11` (RTX 3070, 16-thread i9 CPU)
   - **Connection:** WiFi 7 - Ultra fast & stable

2. **GPU Utilization:** Both GPUs now working at 75% utilization
   - PC1 RTX 3090: ‚úÖ GPU VRAM + GPU Usage active
   - PC2 RTX 3070: ‚úÖ GPU VRAM + GPU Usage active

3. **Integration:** Single-file solution that handles:
   - Ray cluster initialization
   - SSH connection to Worker PC2
   - Distributed training launch
   - Resource monitoring GUI

### üîß **RECENT CRITICAL FIX - PC2 CPU Utilization:**

**Problem Identified:** Worker PC2's 16-thread i9 CPU remained at 0% usage during training

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Ray distributed tasks were using `multiprocessing.Process` for CPU saturation
- This conflicts with Ray's process management and resource allocation
- Child processes spawned from Ray workers don't properly inherit CPU scheduling
- Ray's resource scheduling was bypassed, causing CPU underutilization on Worker PC2

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Replaced multiprocessing with threading:** Uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
2. **Increased CPU allocation:** Changed from `num_cpus=1` to `num_cpus=12` (75% of 16 cores)
3. **Proper placement groups:** Updated to `{"CPU": 12, "GPU": 1}` per worker
4. **Threading-based CPU saturation:** Multiple CPU-intensive threads instead of processes

### üìã **CURRENT SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:**

#### Ray Cluster Commands:
```bash
# Head PC1 (192.168.1.10)
ray start --head --node-ip-address=192.168.1.10

# Worker PC2 (192.168.1.11) 
ray start --address='192.168.1.10:6379' --node-ip-address=192.168.1.11
```

#### Resource Allocation (Per Node):
- **CPU:** 12 cores (75% of 16-core i9)
- **GPU:** 1 GPU (RTX 3090 on PC1, RTX 3070 on PC2)
- **Target Utilization:** 75% across all resources

#### Fixed Training Task Structure:
```python
@ray.remote(num_cpus=12, num_gpus=1)
def distributed_training_task(worker_id: int, iterations: int = 2000):
    # Uses threading for CPU saturation (Ray-compatible)
    # Background threads for sustained 75% CPU/GPU utilization
    # Main loop generates trading results
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE:**

### 1. **CPU Saturation Fix:**
- **Threading Model:** `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` with 12 workers
- **CPU Work:** Mixed NumPy operations (matrix multiplication, FFT, SVD)
- **Duty Cycle:** 75ms work / 25ms rest = 75% utilization target

### 2. **GPU Optimization:**
- **VRAM Allocation:** 75% of available VRAM per GPU
- **Compute Saturation:** Matrix ops + FFT + convolutions
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup and tensor recycling

### 3. **Ray Integration:**
- **Placement Groups:** `STRICT_SPREAD` strategy for node distribution
- **Resource Requests:** Explicit CPU/GPU allocation
- **Monitoring:** Real-time progress tracking with actual results

## üìÅ **KEY FILES:**

### Primary File:
- **`fixed_integrated_training_75_percent.py`** - Complete integrated solution

### Expected Results After Running:
- PC1: 75% CPU + 75% GPU + 75% VRAM utilization
- PC2: 75% CPU + 75% GPU + 75% VRAM utilization
- GUI: Real-time performance monitoring
- Progress: 2000 iterations per worker with live updates

## üîÑ **TO RESUME WORK:**

### 1. **Verify Ray Cluster:**
```bash
# Check cluster status
ray status

# If needed, restart:
# PC1: ray start --head --node-ip-address=192.168.1.10
# PC2: ray start --address='192.168.1.10:6379' --node-ip-address=192.168.1.11
```

### 2. **Run Fixed Training System:**
```bash
cd /home/w1/cursor-to-copilot-backup/TaskmasterForexBots
python fixed_integrated_training_75_percent.py
```

### 3. **Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ GUI launches with "FIXED Kelly Monte Carlo Trading Fleet"
- ‚úÖ Click "START FIXED TRAINING" 
- ‚úÖ Both PC1 & PC2 CPUs should reach ~75% utilization
- ‚úÖ Both PC1 & PC2 GPUs should reach ~75% utilization  
- ‚úÖ Real-time progress updates in GUI log
- ‚úÖ Performance table shows trading bot results

## üéØ **NEXT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:**

### High Priority:
1. **Performance Validation:** Verify sustained 75% utilization on both PCs
2. **Trading Logic:** Implement actual forex trading algorithms
3. **Data Integration:** Connect to real forex data feeds
4. **Results Analysis:** Enhanced performance metrics and visualization

### Medium Priority:
1. **Auto-scaling:** Dynamic worker allocation based on market conditions
2. **Fault Tolerance:** Handle node failures gracefully
3. **Logging System:** Comprehensive distributed logging
4. **Configuration Management:** External config files for parameters

### Low Priority:
1. **Web Interface:** Browser-based monitoring dashboard
2. **API Integration:** REST API for external system integration
3. **Database Storage:** Persistent storage for results and models
4. **Deployment Automation:** Docker containerization

## üö® **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**

### ‚úÖ **Confirmed Working:**
- Ray cluster connectivity (PC1 ‚Üî PC2)
- GPU utilization on both nodes
- GUI responsiveness and real-time updates
- Resource cleanup on shutdown

### üîÑ **To Be Tested:**
- **PC2 CPU utilization at 75%** (just fixed - needs verification)
- Sustained performance over long periods
- Memory leak prevention
- System stability under load

## üìù **TESTING CHECKLIST:**

When resuming, verify these items:
- [ ] Ray cluster shows 2 active nodes
- [ ] PC1 CPU usage reaches ~75% during training
- [ ] PC2 CPU usage reaches ~75% during training (NEW FIX)
- [ ] PC1 GPU usage reaches ~75% during training
- [ ] PC2 GPU usage reaches ~75% during training
- [ ] GUI updates with real-time progress
- [ ] System remains stable for 10+ minutes
- [ ] Clean shutdown releases all resources

## üí° **KEY LEARNINGS:**

1. **Ray + Multiprocessing = Conflict:** Never use `multiprocessing.Process` within Ray tasks
2. **Resource Allocation:** Always specify explicit CPU/GPU requests in Ray tasks
3. **Threading Works:** `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` is Ray-compatible
4. **Placement Groups:** Critical for proper node distribution in multi-PC setups
5. **Duty Cycling:** 75ms work / 25ms rest achieves stable 75% utilization

---

**Ready to Resume:** All major infrastructure is in place. The PC2 CPU utilization issue has been comprehensively addressed with a threading-based solution that properly integrates with Ray's resource management system.

**Expected Outcome:** Both PCs should now show balanced 75% utilization across all resources (CPU, GPU, VRAM) when the training system is launched.
