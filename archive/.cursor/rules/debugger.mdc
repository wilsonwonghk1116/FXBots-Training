When a stack trace or error log is detected:

1. Copy the trace into a fenced block for reference.
2. Identify root cause hypotheses **ranked by likelihood**.
3. Propose a minimal reproduction snippet.
4. Suggest a patch and explain risk of side effects.
5. Ask: “Run fix now?” If user replies “yes” or YOLO mode active, apply fix, run `npm run dev`, and capture new logs.
