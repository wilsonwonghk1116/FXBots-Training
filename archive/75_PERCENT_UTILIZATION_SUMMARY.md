# üéØ 75% Utilization Optimization Summary

## Overview

The automated cluster training system has been optimized for **75% resource utilization** across CPU, GPU, and VRAM on both PCs to ensure sustainable, efficient training without system overload.

## üîß Resource Allocation Changes

### **Before (100% Utilization)**
- **PC1**: 80 CPUs, 1 GPU, 24GB VRAM
- **PC2**: 16 CPUs, 1 GPU, 8GB VRAM
- **Total**: 96 CPUs, 2 GPUs, 32GB VRAM

### **After (75% Utilization)**
- **PC1**: 60 CPUs (75% of 80), 1 GPU with 18GB VRAM limit (75% of 24GB)
- **PC2**: 12 CPUs (75% of 16), 1 GPU with 6GB VRAM limit (75% of 8GB)
- **Total**: 72 CPUs, 2 GPUs with 24GB VRAM total (75% utilization)

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### **Ray Actor Configuration**
```python
# Updated Ray actor resource allocation
@ray.remote(num_cpus=8, num_gpus=0.75)  # DistributedForexTrainer
@ray.remote(num_cpus=3, num_gpus=0)     # MassiveScaleCoordinator
```

### **Training Parameters (75% Optimized)**

- **Parallel Episodes**: 6 (reduced from 8)

### **GPU Memory Management**
- **VRAM Usage**: 75% limit on both GPUs
- **PyTorch Memory Fraction**: 0.75
- **CUDA Allocation**: Optimized with `max_split_size_mb:512`

## üìä Expected Performance

### **Throughput (75% Utilization)**
- **Steps per Second**: ~15,000 (reduced from ~20,000)
- **Total Training Steps**: 200 million (unchanged)
- **Estimated Duration**: ~3.7 hours (slightly increased for sustainability)

### **Resource Monitoring**
- **CPU Usage Target**: ‚â§75%
- **GPU VRAM Target**: ‚â§75%
- **Memory Usage Target**: ‚â§75%
- **Real-time monitoring**: Built-in resource tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### **Cluster Configuration (`cluster_config.py`)**
```python
# 75% Utilization Settings
UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE = 0.75

# Calculated Resource Allocation
PC1_CPUS = 60  # 75% of 80
PC2_CPUS = 12  # 75% of 16
PC1_OBJECT_STORE_MEMORY = 18GB  # 75% of 24GB
PC2_OBJECT_STORE_MEMORY = 6GB   # 75% of 8GB

# Ray Actor Limits
RAY_TRAINER_CPUS = 8
RAY_TRAINER_GPU_FRACTION = 0.75
```

### **Environment Variables (Auto-configured)**
```bash
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:512
OMP_NUM_THREADS=30  # 75% of PC1 cores
MKL_NUM_THREADS=30  # 75% of PC1 cores
```

## üéÆ Usage

### **No Changes Required**
The 75% utilization is automatically applied when you run:

```bash
python automated_cluster_training.py
```

### **Training Modes (Both Optimized for 75%)**
- **Test Scale**: 2 generations √ó 10 episodes √ó 100 steps
- **Full Scale**: 200 generations √ó 1000 episodes √ó 1000 steps
