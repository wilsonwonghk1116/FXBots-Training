# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Advanced Neural Network Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement multi-layer LSTM with self-attention for trading intelligence, optimized for GPU.
# Details:
- Use PyTorch nn.LSTM and nn.MultiheadAttention.
- Design for large batch sizes and sequence lengths.
- Integrate mixed precision (torch.cuda.amp) for FP16/FP32.
- Profile VRAM usage with torch.cuda.memory_allocated().
- Use FlashAttention (if compatible) for further speedup.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for forward/backward pass, VRAM profiling, and output shapes. Benchmark with synthetic data.
