# Task ID: 6
# Title: Design Evolutionary Training System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a scalable evolutionary algorithm for parallel training and evaluation of 300 bots.
# Details:
- Use Ray for parallelism and future cluster scaling.
- Implement population management, selection, mutation, and crossover.
- Support checkpointing and recovery.
- Optimize for CPU/GPU resource allocation.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for population evolution, checkpointing, and parallel execution. Validate with 300+ agents.
