# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Modular Codebase Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and scaffold modular architecture with clear separation for environment, model, trainer, and utilities.
# Details:
- Create Python packages: environment/, models/, trainer/, utils/.
- Use abstract base classes for extensibility.
- Follow PEP8 and modern Python packaging standards.
- Add __init__.py and module docstrings.

# Test Strategy:
Run pytest to ensure modules import correctly and basic instantiation works.
