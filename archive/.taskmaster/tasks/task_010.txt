# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Confidence Scoring and Prediction Reliability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement confidence scoring for model predictions to inform trading decisions.
# Details:
- Use softmax probabilities, entropy, or Bayesian dropout for uncertainty estimation.
- Log confidence scores with each trade.
- Integrate into agent's action selection logic.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for confidence computation, integration tests for trade filtering based on confidence.
