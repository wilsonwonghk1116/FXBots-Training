# Task ID: 8
# Title: Optimize RTX 3090 Hardware Utilization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Tune training loop and memory management for 95%+ VRAM and GPU usage, leveraging Ampere features.
# Details:
- Use torch.cuda.amp for mixed precision.
- Aggressively tune batch sizes and sequence lengths.
- Profile with torch.profiler and nvidia-smi.
- Implement garbage collection and memory pinning.
- Monitor and adjust power/thermal limits (nvidia-smi, see [1]).

# Test Strategy:
Run training with synthetic and real data, confirm 95%+ VRAM/GPU usage via nvidia-smi and logs.
