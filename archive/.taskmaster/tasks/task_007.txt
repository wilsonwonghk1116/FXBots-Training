# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate Real-time Resource Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement real-time monitoring for GPU, VRAM, CPU, and thermal metrics with alerting.
# Details:
- Use nvidia-ml-py3 for GPU/VRAM/temperature.
- Use psutil for CPU and memory.
- Log metrics to file and expose via REST API (FastAPI).
- Set thresholds for alerts (e.g., 95% VRAM, 80Â°C GPU).

# Test Strategy:
Simulate high load and verify metrics collection, logging, and alert triggering.
