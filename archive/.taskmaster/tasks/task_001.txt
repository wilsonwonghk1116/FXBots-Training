# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize Git repository, establish branching strategy, and configure Python 3.8+ environment with dependency management for RTX 3090 and dual Xeon CPUs.
# Details:
- Use Git with GitHub/GitLab, set up main/dev branches.
- Create Python 3.8+ virtual environment using venv or conda.
- Add requirements.txt or environment.yml with PyTorch (latest, CUDA 12+), Ray, YAML, pytest, and monitoring libraries (nvidia-ml-py3, psutil).
- Ensure CUDA 12+ and cuDNN are installed for RTX 3090 compatibility.
- Document setup in README.md.

# Test Strategy:
Verify environment setup by running 'python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"' and basic Git operations.
