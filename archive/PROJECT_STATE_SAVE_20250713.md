# TaskmasterForexBots Project State Save - July 13, 2025

## Current Status Summary
- **Ray Cluster Setup**: ✅ WORKING - 2-PC distributed cluster established
- **PC1 (Head Node)**: 192.168.1.10:6379 (RTX 3090)
- **PC2 (Worker Node)**: 192.168.1.11 (RTX 3070)
- **Main Issue**: PC2 GPU/CPU utilization remains at 0% during training
- **Primary Goal**: Achieve 75% CPU/GPU/VRAM utilization on both PCs

## Key Files and Their Status

### 1. `fixed_integrated_training_75_percent.py` - MAIN TRAINING SYSTEM
**Status**: ENHANCED with comprehensive fixes
**Last Changes Made**:
- ✅ Fixed `ray_futures` AttributeError by initializing in constructor
- ✅ Enhanced GPU workload (2048x2048 tensors, 8 batches, FFT/convolution ops)
- ✅ Enhanced CPU workload (1200x1200 matrices, SVD, FFT operations)
- ✅ Fixed training flow to always use distributed Ray training
- ✅ Increased iterations to 1000 for sustained 75% utilization
- ✅ Added controlled delay (0.01s) to maintain 75% vs 100% usage

**Key Methods Fixed**:
- `__init__()`: Added `self.ray_futures = []` initialization
- `start_training()`: Now always uses distributed Ray training
- `start_distributed_ray_training()`: Added proper ray_futures initialization
- `create_distributed_training_task()`: Enhanced for 75% GPU/CPU utilization
- `start_distributed_workload()`: Increased iterations to 1000

## Ray Cluster Commands (WORKING)

### PC1 (Head Node) - 192.168.1.10
```bash
ray start --head --node-ip-address=192.168.1.10
```

### PC2 (Worker Node) - 192.168.1.11
```bash
ray start --address='192.168.1.10:6379' --node-ip-address=192.168.1.11
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check cluster status
ray status

# List nodes
ray list nodes

# Check resources
python -c "import ray; ray.init(address='192.168.1.10:6379'); print(ray.cluster_resources()); print(ray.nodes())"
```

## Environment Setup

### Python Environment
- **Version**: Python 3.12.2 (Training_env conda environment)
- **Note**: Originally written for Python 3.13.2, but using 3.12.2 for better PyTorch compatibility

### Required Packages
```bash
conda activate Training_env
pip install ray[default] torch PyQt6 numpy pandas psutil gputil
```

## Current Problem Analysis

### Issue Description
- Ray cluster shows 2 nodes, 2 GPUs properly connected
- Simple Ray GPU test works on both PCs
- Main application only utilizes PC1 (45-46% CPU, high GPU VRAM)
- PC2 remains completely idle (0% CPU, 0% GPU usage)

### Error Previously Fixed
```
❌ CRITICAL: ray_futures attribute not found!
Entering file-based monitoring for demo mode.
```
**Resolution**: Added `self.ray_futures = []` in `__init__()` method

### Debugging Enhancements Added
- Comprehensive logging in `start_distributed_workload()`
- Ray futures validation in monitoring thread
- Detailed placement group creation logging
- Real-time GPU/CPU usage tracking

## Enhanced Workload Specifications

### GPU Workload (Per Worker)
- **Tensor Size**: 2048x2048 (increased from 1200x1200)
- **Batch Size**: 8 batches per iteration
- **Operations**: Matrix multiplication, FFT, sigmoid, convolution
- **Target**: 75% GPU utilization with controlled delay

### CPU Workload (Per Worker)
- **Matrix Size**: 1200x1200 (increased from 800x800)
- **Batch Size**: 4 CPU tasks in parallel
- **Operations**: Matrix dot product, SVD decomposition, FFT
- **Target**: 75% CPU utilization

### Training Parameters
- **Iterations per Worker**: 1000 (increased from 300)
- **Delay per Iteration**: 0.01 seconds (for 75% vs 100% usage)
- **Total Workers**: 2 (one per GPU)
- **Placement Strategy**: STRICT_SPREAD

## Next Steps for Resumption

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Ray Cluster**: Ensure both PCs are still connected
   ```bash
   ray status
   ```

2. **Run Enhanced System**: Execute the fixed training system
   ```bash
   cd /home/w1/cursor-to-copilot-backup/TaskmasterForexBots
   python fixed_integrated_training_75_percent.py
   ```

3. **Monitor Both PCs**: Check CPU/GPU usage on both machines during training

### If PC2 Still Idle
1. **Check Ray Worker Logs**: Look for task assignment issues
2. **Verify Placement Groups**: Ensure STRICT_SPREAD is working
3. **Test Simple Ray Task**: Run basic GPU test to verify Ray distribution

### Performance Monitoring
- **Target CPU**: 75% on both PCs
- **Target GPU**: 75% utilization on both GPUs
- **Target VRAM**: ~75% usage for optimal performance
- **System Stability**: Ubuntu should remain smooth and responsive

## File Backup Status
- **Main Training File**: `fixed_integrated_training_75_percent.py` (ENHANCED)
- **Ray Cluster Scripts**: Available in project directory
- **Configuration Files**: `config.yaml` and related configs preserved
- **Results Files**: `fleet_results.json` for demo mode fallback
