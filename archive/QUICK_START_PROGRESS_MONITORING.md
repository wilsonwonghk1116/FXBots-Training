# Quick Start: Enhanced Progress Monitoring 🚀

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Install Required Packages
```bash
# Install all required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install individually if needed:
pip install torch numpy ray tqdm psutil GPUtil pandas PyYAML requests
```

### 2. Start Ray Cluster
```bash
# If Ray cluster is not running, start it:
ray start --head

# Or connect to existing cluster (if available)
ray status
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
# Quick test to verify everything works
python test_progress_monitoring.py
```

## ⚡ Quick Usage

```bash
# Run 5-minute training with full progress monitoring
python rtx3070_optimized_trainer.py --duration=5
```

## 📊 What You'll See

### Real-Time Progress Bars
```
🚀 Overall Training Progress:  50%|████████░░░░░░░░░░| 50.0%/100% [02:30<02:30]
👷 Workers Completed:          50%|█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░| 1/2 workers [02:25]
```

### Status Updates (Every 30 Seconds)
```
==================================================
📊 TRAINING STATUS UPDATE
⏰ Time: 2.5/5.0 minutes (50.0%)
🎯 Workers: 1/2 completed (50.0%)
⏳ ETA: 2.5 minutes remaining
==================================================
```

### GPU Monitoring (Every 60 Seconds)
```
🎮 GPU 0 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090): 70.2% VRAM, 16.85GB/24.00GB
🎮 GPU 1 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070): 59.1% VRAM, 4.54GB/7.68GB
```

### Worker Completion Alerts
```
✅ 1 additional worker(s) completed! Total: 1/2
```

### Final Results Collection
```
📥 Collecting Results: 100%|██████████| 2/2 results [00:01<00:00,  1.95it/s]
📊 Result 1/2: Worker 0 - 150 iterations, 45000 operations
📊 Result 2/2: Worker 100 - 148 iterations, 42000 operations
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tqdm'"
**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install tqdm
```

### Issue: "Ray cluster not available"
**Solution**:
```bash
ray stop  # Stop any existing cluster
ray start --head  # Start fresh cluster
```

### Issue: "CUDA not available"
**Note**: The system will automatically fall back to CPU-only monitoring. Training will still work but GPU monitoring will be disabled.

### Issue: No GPU monitoring displayed
**Check**:
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}, GPUs: {torch.cuda.device_count()}')"
```

## 📋 Verification Checklist

Before running full training, verify:

- ✅ `pip install -r requirements.txt` completed successfully
- ✅ `ray status` shows active cluster
- ✅ `python test_progress_monitoring.py` passes all tests
- ✅ GPUs detected: `nvidia-smi` shows your RTX 3090 and RTX 3070

## 🎯 Expected Timeline (5-minute training)

```
00:00 - Training starts, progress bars appear
00:30 - First detailed status update
01:00 - First GPU monitoring update  
02:30 - Mid-training status update
04:30 - Pre-completion status update
05:00 - Workers complete, result collection begins
05:01 - Training completed, summary displayed
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Window Size**: Use a terminal window at least 80 characters wide for best progress bar display
2. **Monitoring Frequency**: Status updates every 30s, GPU monitoring every 60s - no need to worry if nothing appears immediately
3. **Early Termination**: Press Ctrl+C to stop training early - results will still be collected for completed workers
4. **Log Files**: All progress information is also logged to console - scroll up to see detailed history
